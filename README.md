# Integrated-Data-Processing-and-Analysis-Pipeline
A robust pipeline for extracting data from Kaggle using its API, processing and transforming the data using Python (utilizing Pandas for data manipulation)


Loading the transformed data into Microsoft SQL Server for further analysis and querying. The project leverages SQL for data transformations, aggregation, and querying to derive insights and generate reports.

# Key Features:
Data Extraction: Retrieves datasets from Kaggle using API endpoints.
Data Transformation: Utilizes Python and Pandas for cleaning, transformation, and preparation of data.
Database Integration: Loads processed data into Microsoft SQL Server for storage and structured querying.
SQL Analysis: Implements SQL queries for further data manipulation, aggregation, and generation of analytical insights.
End-to-End Pipeline: Provides a complete workflow from initial data acquisition to final data analysis and reporting.

# Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas
Microsoft SQL Server
Kaggle API
SQL for data querying and analysis

# Future Enhancements:
Automated scheduling of data extraction and processing.
Integration with additional data sources.
Implementation of advanced analytics and machine learning models using SQL.
This project is ideal for anyone looking to learn about data integration, processing, and analysis using Python and SQL within a structured pipeline environment.
